        <h3>Rupi Kaur is a Canadian poet, writer, and illustrator who gained widespread recognition for her collections of poetry. She was born on October 5, 1992, in Punjab, India, and later moved to Canada with her family. Her work is known for its simplicity often accompanied by her own illustrations.</h3>
        <h3>Kaur's poetry and prose focus on a wide range of themes, including love, self-empowerment, femininity, trauma, healing, and identity. She writes from a deeply personal perspective, drawing from her own life experiences, cultural background as a woman of Punjabi Sikh descent, and her experiences with love and heartbreak.</h3>
